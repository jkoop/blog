## Blog Post Title From First Header

Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### This is a header

#### Some SQL Code

```sql
SELECT This, Is, A, Code, Block -- with comments
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some Shell Code

```sh
echo "This is a shell script code block"

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

for thing in $things; do
    echo "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
done
```
